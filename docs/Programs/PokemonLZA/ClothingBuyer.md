## Instructions

1. The selection arrow is on the first item in the menu for buying clothing. (See example picture.)
2. Start the program in-game. The program will automatically stop when the number of categories is hit (see options).

The program will buy out all clothing and color variants in the specified number of categories. It will not automatically put on any of the purchased clothing.

Make sure you have enough money, the program will not detect when you are out of cash.

## Options

### Number of categories:

The number of clothing categories (ex. Footwear, Gloves, Bags) that the shop you are in has. Minimum is 1, maximum is 9.

- To purchase everything in a shop: set the number of categories to match the shop.
- To purchase only one category of clothing: set the number of categories to 1 and navigate to that category. Leave the selection arrow on the first item. 
- If this number is larger than the number of categories in the shop, the program will still run and complete. However, it will take much longer as it attempts buy already purchased items.

### Go Home when Done:

Go to the Switch Home to idle when finished.
